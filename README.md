## Overview
### Description
Cooking application that allows people to find cooking recipes suited to their taste. They can find cuisines based off their cooking level or a certain recipe that they're looking for.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking/Food/Cooking
- **Mobile:** This app would be only developed for mobile.  Functionality would only be limited to IOS.
- **Story:** Analyzes users food choices, and connects them to other reicpes. The user can then decide to favorite the recipe to use or to add comments about the recipe.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app but it mainly target for people who want to llok at recipes of cooking new dishes.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how often they want to cook or to look at recipes for food.
- **Scope:** First we would start with a black user, then perhaps they could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
